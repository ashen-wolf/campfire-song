Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you ever see a pastor
Kissing a minor?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you ever see a horse
feeling remorse?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you ever see a beatnik
having a picnic?"
Down by the bay.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you ever see a Watermelon
becoming a felon?"
Down by the bay.

Down at my bae's
Where the Water-Buffalos mow
Back to her crib
They always go
For if I die
My babe will say
"Did you ever see a Water-Buffalo
eating your bro
Down at your bae's.

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
Back to my home
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off?
Heâ€™s all right now."
Down by the bay.
